# Games
C# project for CodeLouisville

This project should only require Visual Studio 2015 to run as it uses LocalDB which is built in.

Download the project and open the Games.sln. Click OK to trust it. At the top of Visual Studio select your browser of choice and hti the play button or Ctrl+F5 and the project should open up in your browser after the required packages are downloaded.

I have included a small seed database to show examples and to play around with.
